# PythonAPI-QA
Sample POC code to validate api calls using Python 



apiretoolvalidator
In this code, we’ve created an APIClient class that can be used to make HTTP requests. You can create an instance of this class and use the make_request method to send requests and receive responses. The status code and response data are returned, which can then be used in Retool components.

In your Retool application, you can use the APIClient class to make requests and handle responses. You can use Retool components such as Text Inputs, Buttons, Tables, and Text Elements to build a user interface that interacts with the APIClient.

Here’s an example of how you might use this in a Retool component:

# Create an instance of the APIClient
api_client = APIClient(base_url="https://api.example.com", authorization_key="Bearer your-api-key")

# Make an API request
status_code, response_data = api_client.make_request("/your-api-endpoint")

# Display the status code and response data in Retool components
status_code_component.text = f"Status Code: {status_code}"
response_data_component.text = f"Response Data: {response_data}"

This separates the concerns of HTTP requests from the Retool interface, making it easier to manage and use within Retool components.
